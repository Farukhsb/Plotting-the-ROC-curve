# Plotting-the-ROC-curve

## Project Overview 
In this exercise, we aim to enhance our understanding of model performance beyond accuracy assessment. By calculating the Area Under the Curve (AUC) scores and visualising Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves for both kNN and logistic regression models, we seek to discern their comparative effectiveness. Leveraging this insight, we can discern the most suitable model for various real-world scenarios, thereby optimising decision-making in healthcare contexts.
